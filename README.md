Population structure analysis using RNA-sequence data

Eulimnogammarus verrucosus is an endemical amphipod species of lake Baikal. Its population structure seems to be complicated (Gurkov et al. 2019). In this study, transcriptomic data of 63 animals collected in Bolshie Koty was attached to previous data. COI gene of the mitochondrial sequence was used.
In NOTEBOOK you can find a detailed description of the analysis methods used. There are also 
 - fastqc reports about reads quality before and after trimming for the whole dataset and for aligned at COI.
 - qualimap reports of alignment quality after different parameters of alignment.
 - readstovars. sh - a script used for alignment and variant calling
 - color_network.R - R script used for visualizing of nets
